# Voyager CRS Data Extraction and Plotting (VCRS DEP) program  
  
The purpose of this program is to extract CRS data colleected by the two Voyager probes from omniweb and make a local SQL database out of it. Then the user can, with a few simple commands, plot the CRS data as required.  
  
As I didn't know about git at that time, my version of source control was to give files and folders different names. In spirit of that primitive tradition, versions of this code will be stored in folders named "PG number" where "number" = version of the code.  
  
To get more info about this project, refer to the PG folders.
